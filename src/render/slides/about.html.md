### My work

I began working as an HTML coder in 2005 . In two years, as it usually happens with HTML coders, I learned JavaScript and  devoted myself entirely to programming. Gradually I also learned a complete set of server technologies: programming languages (PHP, Python), databases (MySQL, PostreSQL), configuring servers and so on. You can get more information about my experience in [my CV](#resume).

### My hobbies

Web development is not only a job for me, it’s my hobby as well. I regularly read a lot of thematic blogs, develop my own projects and contribute to open source projects.

Besides, I like to travel. By car, on foot, by plane or by train, across Russia and abroad, in a tent or in a hotel — it doesn't matter. The main thing is to get pleasure from all stages: from planning the trip to returning home in wet boots and with a torn backpack.

In my spare time I [read books](//bibla.ru/albburtsev/), [watch TV shows](//myshows.me/albburtsev) and improve my English. Also I'm a husband and a father.

### Education

I [graduated](//istina.msu.ru/workers/1580266/) from Moscow State University (Chemical department, 2001 — 2007).
